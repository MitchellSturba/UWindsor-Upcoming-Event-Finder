# UWindsor-Upcoming-Event-Finder
<h2>Overview</h2>
A python script that displays the date, description, time, and location of upcoming events of the week, and asks the user to enter any specific dates they wish to see. This was one of the first small projects I made with python and works as a functional reminder for any important upcoming events.
